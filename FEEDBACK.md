# Feedback
I realy enjoyed this project. My Typescript knowledge was a litte bit rusty, but i managed to get it working. The idea of an project as an assesment is great, it gives you a real world experience.

## Improvements
For improvements, i hardcoded the token in the code. I think it would be better to use a config file or environment variable to store the token. This way, you can easily change it without modifying the code.
The ui is a bit basic, but it works. I would like to add some styling to make it look better. I would also like to add some error handling to the code, so that it doesn't crash if something goes wrong.
More comments would be nice, but i think the code is pretty self-explanatory.
